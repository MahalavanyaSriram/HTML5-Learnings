                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra">algebra</a>, a <b>quadratic equation</b> (from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin">Latin</a> <i>quadratus</i> for "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square">square</a>")
                    is any equation having the form<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


                    <big><b><i>ax<sup>2</sup></i>+<i>bx</i>+<i>c</i>= 0</b></big><br> where <i>x</i> represents an unknown, and <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> represent known numbers such that <i>a</i> is not equal to 0. If a = 0, then the equation
                    is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear">linear</a>, not quadratic. The numbers
                    <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, ind <i>c</i> are the <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient">coefficients</a></i> of the equation, and may be distinguished by calling them, respectively, the <i>quadratic coefficient</i>, the linear
                    coefficient and the<i> constant or free term.</i></p>
                <p>
                    Because the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called "
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univariate"></a>univariate". The quadratic equation only contains powers of <i>x</i> that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_equation">polynomial equation</a>, and in particular it
                    is a
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_degree_polynomial_equation">second degree polynomial equation
                </a> since the greatest power is two.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quadratic equations can be solved by a process known in American English as factoring and in other varieties of English as <i>factorising</i>, by completing the square, by using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square">quadratic formula</a>,
                    or by graphing. Solutions to problems equivalent to the quadratic equation were known as early as 2000 BC.

                    Solving the quadratic equation
                </h2>
                <p>
                    A quadratic equation with real or complex coefficients has two solutions, called <i>roots</i>. These two solutions may or may not be distinct, and they may or may not be real.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be possible to express a quadratic equation <i>ax<sup>2</sup></i>+<i>bx</i>+<i>c</i>= 0 as a product <i>(px + q)(rx + s) = 0</i>. In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of <i>p, q, r,</i> and
                    <i>s</i> that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the "Zero Factor Property" states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if <i>px + q = 0</i> or <i>rx + s = 0</i>.
                    Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed. If one is given a quadratic equation in the form <i>ax<sup>2</sup></i>+<i>bx</i>+<i>c</i>= 0, the sought factorization
                    has the form <i>(x + q)(x + s)</i>, and one has to find two numbers <i>q</i> and <i>s</i> that add up to <i>b</i> and whose product is <i>c</i> (this is sometimes called <b>"Vieta's rule"</b> and is related to Vieta's formulas). As
                    an example,
                    <i>x<sup>2</sup></i>+<i>5x</i>+<i>6</i>= 0 factors as <i>(x + 3)(x + 2)</i>. The more general case where a does not equal 1 can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all
                    by inspection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except for special cases such as where <i>b</i> = 0 or <i>c</i> = 0, factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical
                    applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection
